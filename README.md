##GA WDI NYC Jan/Feb 2014 Project 1



###NY Times Headlines • Today's Date • Random Year



#####I created this web application for a project in the Web Development Intensive held at General Assembly in New York City in February, 2014.

#####The site uses the NYTimes article search API to return random headline articles from today's date in a random year.

#####The design and style of the site was inspired by Jacob Harris' Times Haiku Generator

#####Hope he doesn't mind...

###API's:
#####NYT Article Search API.
#####The Development Mode Uses Mail Catcher.
