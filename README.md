#### <em>NY Times Headlines • Today's Date • Random Year</em>
<br />
<br />
#####What has been will be again,<br />
#####what has been done will be done again;<br />
#####there is nothing new under the sun.<br />
-Ecclesiastes 1:9-<br />
<br />

###Overview
<br />
I created this web application for a project in the Web Development Intensive held at General Assembly in New York City in February, 2014.

The site uses the NYTimes article search API to return random headline articles from today's date in a random year.

The design and style of the site was inspired by Jacob Harris' Times Haiku Generator

Hope he doesn't mind...
